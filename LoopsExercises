Exercise 6.1
Write a program that continues to ask the user for a number
between one and eleven (inclusive) until the total of the numbers
is greater than 21. Be sure to reject any number that is not between 
1 and 11 (inclusive). For example:
"Please pick a number between 1 and 11: 4
Please pick a number between 1 and 11: 12
Out of range; rejected

Please pick a number between 1 and 11: -1
Out of range; rejected

Please pick a number between 1 and 11: 9
Please pick a number between 1 and 11: 8
Please pick a number between 1 and 11: 7
The total is 28"

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main () {
    int num; 
    int total = 0;
    while (total < 22) {
        cout<<"Please enter a number between 1 and 11: ";
        cin>>num;
        cout<<num;
        cout<<endl;
        if ((num < 1) || (num > 11)) {
            cout<<"Out of range; rejected.";
            cout<<endl;
        }
        else {
            total = total + num;
        }
    }
    cout<<"The total is ";
    cout<<total<<endl;

return 0;
}

Exercise 6.2
Modify the program in the chapter that produces a square to instead
produce a triangle of a certain size. The output should look like
the example below. This is an example of where you are better off spending 
more time thinking than typing; you only need to change one or two lines in the
program to get the desired effect:

Enter size: 5

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main () {
    int rows, cols, size;
    cout<<"Enter size: ";
    cin>>size;
    cout<<size;
    cout<<endl;
    rows = 0;
    while (rows < size) {
        cols = 0;
        while (cols <= rows) {
            cout<<"*";
            cols = cols + 1;
        }
        rows = rows + 1;
        cout<<endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
